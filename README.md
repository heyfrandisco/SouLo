# **SouLo** (v0.5.1)
### Final Project for the Sound Design Course

SouLO is a project using the **yolo11n** model developed by Ultralytics. This model is used to detect and label entities from the real world. Those labels are used to define a mood, recurring to a model with a **Random Forest Classifier**. The mood defines the base chords and the objects create a melody based on their position. 

It is, currently, a proof of concept.
